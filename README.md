# pep8
https://learn.udacity.com/ : In this project, you will predict customer churn using clean code principles. You will be refactoring, optimizing, writing tests and logs to predict which customers are likely to churn. Additionally, you will be adding documentation and ensuring your code meets PEP8 standards. This project will simulate a real-world project where the first iteration of your churn model has been completed for you, but itâ€™s your turn to perform the steps to prepare it for production.  This project will be a great addition to your portfolio to show off your production coding skills.
